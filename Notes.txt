RISV

- Try out RISC-V GNU toolchain
- Check if time.h works for benchmarking
- Use RDCYCLE to benchmark code


## theories
- Diff between program execution time and
  simulator overhead time
  (assuming the total time taken is more
   than the program execution time)
Tm = time to execute on machine
Ts = time to execute on simulator
  is it as simple as diff between Ts - Tm.




simulator takes more time
how to benchmark
/ try with code
- RDCYCLE
- RISCV time benchmark always gives same
  elapsed time for a given input size run
  on a program (is it reliable?)
- is the time calculated based on
  cycle count
  e.g. 20000000 and 20000 microsec
  and  2000000 and 2000 microsec
- based on the above calculations and observations
  it seems the clock speed is 1gHz (assumption: time
  is calculated based on clock cycle count)
